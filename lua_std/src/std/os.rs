/// Return date and time as table or format it to string.

/// **Signature:**
/// * `([format: string, [time: int]]) -> string | table`
///  
/// Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to the given string format.
///
/// If the `time` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the `os.time` function for a description of this value).
/// Otherwise, `date` formats the current time.
///
/// If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal Time.
/// After this optional character, if format is the string "*t", then date returns a table with the following fields:
/// `year`, `month` (1–12), `day` (1–31), `hour` (0–23), `min` (0–59), `sec` (0–61, due to leap seconds),
/// `wday` (weekday, 1–7, Sunday is 1), `yday` (day of the year, 1–366), and `isdst` (daylight saving flag, a boolean).
/// This last field may be absent if the information is not available.
///
/// If format is not "*t", then date returns the date as a string, formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function `strftime`.
///
/// If format is absent, it defaults to "%c", which gives a human-readable date and time representation using the current locale.
///
/// On non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its reliance on C function `gmtime` and C function `localtime`.
///
/// # Implementation-specific behavior
///
/// *  Implementation of this function does not rely on C library, therefore comments on thread safety do not apply.
///    Calling this function is always thread-safe.
///
///    Output is locale-independent as is the case with all functions provided by this library.
///
/// *  `time` when provided is expected to be number of seconds since Unix epoch (regardless of platform).
///    This is exactly what is returned by [`time`] API.
///
/// *  String formatting is done through [`chrono::format::strftime`] facility.
///    Technically, its template format is a superset of C's `strftime`.
///
/// *  Currently no information about DST is provided.
